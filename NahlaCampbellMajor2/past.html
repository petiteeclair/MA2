        I touched on this before, but this was for a Stevonnie cosplay.
        Stevonnie is the fusion of Steven, the main character, and Connie, his
        best friend and romantic interest. As Steven weilds Rose's shield since
        he inherited her gem, Connie weilds Rose's sword. Together, as
        Stevonnie, the two are able corrupted gems and adversaries alike with
        their combined strengths.

        For this project, I used simple materials because I'm not very
        experienced. I used foam boards that I cut with an exacto knife for the
        blade and regular foam for the hilt. I painted the sword and scabbard in
        various shades of pink which I had to repaint several times to get the
        shades I wanted. I used a wooden dowel that I painted green with light
        green thorns for the grip. I bought some pink and red roses with leaves
        to fill in the white gaps with hot glue and to burn my fingers,
        apparently. I also included a sheer, white lace that I used for a
        previous Halloween costume.
      </p>
      <p>
        My favorite part of this project is actually the hilt. I know it isn't a
        carbon copy of Rose's sword in the show, but that's what I love about
        it. It's got a little of my own influences and interpretation. I
        especially love the leaves along the loop guard. The truth is that it
        was made of foam from the hilt and I needed <i>some</i> way to cover it
        up, so I thought "leaves should work". And it did!

        The shield was a little tricky. Even now, it's still somewhat
        incomplete. For this, I used a bowl from party city and spray painted it
        pink with a gold shimmer. Then I took a lighter pink paint and painted a
        spiral of torns and light green along the base. And then I used a spare
        piece of stock paper to make the center design and hot glued it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I tried to make some sort of backpack or drawstring bag inside the
        shield and glue the string from the bag to the insides. It sort of
        works, as long as I distribute the weight equally on my arm. But I may
        need to consider making a new shield of lighter material and not a
        plexiglass bowl from Party City...

        I was extremely proud of this and I still am! I made this at the start
        of quarentine when I foolishly believed that we'd only have to
        quarentine for a couple of months or so. At the time, my friends and I
        were planning on going to Empire City Con in North Carolina and I
        planned on cosplaying as Connie in her adorable space camp outfit from
        the movie. The convention was supposed to be in November just before
        Thanksgiving, but...

        I used pretty much the same materials in this project as I did with
        Project Rose. I had to do something a little more geometric to the get
        that angular look. It was a little easier than the curved edges in
        Rose's.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really like the touches with the flowers and star stickers and pearls.
        I'm really happy with the pearl design I put on the scabbard because I
        think it serves to show where Connie learned everything she knows about
        swordsmanship: Pearl! To be completely honest, I added the purple and
        blue flowers to fill in some blank or empty spaces on the sword and to
        highlight the difference between the pale and saturated yellows of the
        scabbard.
