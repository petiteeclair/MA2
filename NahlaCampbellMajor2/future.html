        <h2>Descendents Keyblade</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item text">
        <p>
          I had this idea after being obsessed with <i>Descendents</i> from
          Disney and Square Enix's <i>Kingdom Hearts</i>. To be honest,
          <i>Descendents</i> is actually an awful franchise that's badly written
          and main character is completely unlikable. I'm only there for Uma,
          who is very unfairly made to be a villain considering the
          circumstances of the films. But I had this idea the
          <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> and <i>Descendents</i> were in the same universe
          and Descendents took place in the future after Sora's adventures. I
          don't have logistics for how these two universe's can come together
          considering the different rules the govern them, but this really gave
          me a good excuse to make a keyblade for the only good character, Uma.

        <p>
          I am extremely excited for this project! I don't know when I'll have
          time to do something this big and elaborate and maybe it's too soon to
          take on something like this, but I'm just excited.
        </p>
        <p>
          The design is based off of Uma's outfits and aesthetics in the movies
          and the structure is based off the Wheel of Fate keyblade from
          <i>Kingdom Hearts III</i>. Uma's entire motif is centered around
          pirates and ocean and her main color is teal, so I tried to include as
          much of the color as I could without it being overwhelming. And, since
          Uma is the daughter of our poor, unfortunate Ursula, I also made her
          hilt in the shape of an octopus with four tentacles for the guard and
          another two for the grip. The remaining two legs will serve as a
          "keychain" of sorts that will have the symbols for her first mate,
          Harry son of Captain Hook, and her second mate, Gil son of Gaston.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Wheel of Fate keyblade features shrouds on either side of the
          dowel. I, instead, did a shroud on one side that will have seashells
          attached and the flag for Uma's ship on the other side. I added a
          small twist with Uma's flag by adding words that I closely associate
          with her such as freedom, anarchy, and revenge. And, finally, while
          the Wheel of Fate keyblade has a helm, or ship wheel, as the actual
          "blade" part that would deliver the hardest hits. I replaced that part
          with an anchor and nautlius shell with teal and cerulean coral coming
          out of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In all truthfulness, I'm not quite sure what I want to make this
          entire thing out of. I defintely want to use wooden dowels to make a
          'T' cross for the base, string for the shroud, and canvas fabric for
          the flag. Then, there's the rest of it, which I'm most nervous but
          excited for. I was thinking about making the hilt and blade out of
          clay, but with the size of it, it might be too heavy for the dowels to
          hold that weight and also too heavy for me to carry around at
          conventions. Maybe I could use foam? But foam may be a little too
          fragile and conventions are always bustling with movement and I'd hate
          for it to get knocked into and fall apart. If I use enough hot glue,
          then perhaps it'll stay down pretty well. As the DIY moms always say,
          if you burn your hands enough, then it'll surely stay in place. The
          painting will also be really fun. I'll need a <em>lot</em> of teal
          paint and I was thinking of adding gold accents to the nautilus as
          well. I was also thinking of getting some polish spray to give it a
          really glossy finish.
        </p>
        <p>
          All in all, I don't when I'm going to find the time and money to get
          around to this project, but when it comes, it's going to be really
          exciting and fun. Even if I get a little frustrated in the process,
          that's to be expected. Not every project will go by the blueprint;
          sometimes, you'll come up with new ideas or have to improvise. Getting
          to the end goal and seeing the final result is sweet, but the process
          is even sweeter.
