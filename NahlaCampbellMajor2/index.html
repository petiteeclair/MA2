        <h1>Let's Build Some Cosplay Weapons!</h1>
      </div>
      <div class= "grid-item text">
        <p>I love cosplay. It's an artform that I think is so fun and allows 
          everyone of any age, gender, body type, or race to make something that 
          represents a show, movie, book, or game that they really enjoy and be able 
          to show off that love at conventions for hundreds of people. So, while  
          I'm not a great at sewing, I enjoy trying to make weapons for my favorite  
          characters. It's a fun activity to do every now and then to help me destress 
          and allow me get lost in creating things. I know that my creations aren't 
          on a professional level, but just knowing that I put in the time and 
          effort to making something that I'm proud of is more than enough for me. 
          The first weapon that I made (featured below) was Rose's sword and 
          scabbard from popular, Cartoon Network show, <i>Steven Universe</i> for a 
          Stevonnie Halloween cosplay in 2019. Unfortunately, I'd gotten sick the 
          day of and wasn't able get dressed, but I could always wear it to a 
          convention! Or so I thought... 2020 came and kind of ruined any plans to 
          do anything, but I still tried to find time to create something new and 
          come up with a new idea that I'm really excited to share!
